#### 1. ParallelMind should not try to “improve memory.” It should reduce the need to use biological memory at all.
We are not upgrading the brain.  
We are **changing the workload distribution** between:

*   Biological mind (good at understanding, judging, deciding)
    
*   External system (good at storing, organizing, resurfacing)

Thinking energy spent on **understanding**, not filing



#### 2. The goal is not replacement of thinking, it is preservation and extension of thinking.


### Design rule:

Every feature must reduce one of:

*   Memory load 
*   Attention cost   
*   Context loss     
*   Retrieval friction



### Philosophical stance:

*   Brain = processor
    
*   ParallelMind = persistent cognitive state



**ParallelMind counters human limits not by strengthening memory, but by externalizing structure, context, and recall — letting the mind do what it is biologically good at: understanding and deciding.**
