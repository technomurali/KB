6\. Feature Selection (Remove Irrelevant Information)
-----------------------------------------------------

**Goal:** Keep only what matters.

### Sub-steps

*   Remove highly correlated features
    
*   Statistical methods (chi-square, ANOVA)
    
*   Model-based selection (L1, tree importance)
    
*   Recursive feature elimination (RFE)
    

**Outcome:** Reduced dimensionality, better generalization
