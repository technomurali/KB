**Event behind in composing this concept** 


In the Parallelmind application, each node has a section called "purpose." But it only acts as a placeholder until the right questions are asked—only then does the mind begin to form the actual purpose. 
* Q1.Why did I note this?
* Q2.When did it matter?
* Q3.What did it influence?







Understanding: The mind requires a _situation model_ to reason
-------------------------------------------------------

In cognitive psychology, understanding happens only after the brain constructs a **mental situation model**:

*   actors (who/whom) agency
    
*   actions (what/how) object (what)
    
*   time (when) context
    
*   space (where) context 
    
*   causality (why) causality 


*   mechanism, action (how)
    

Without these dimensions, the brain treats information as **isolated tokens**, not reality.

Understanding : Fundamental question words are not language tools — they are cognitive operators
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The words  
**what, why, when, where, how, who**  
are not grammatical conveniences.

They each activate **distinct cognitive subsystems**:


Understanding : The mind cannot reason on fragments,**reasoning requires structured scenes**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




**Understanding** : Without root interrogatives, the brain cannot construct a situation model; without a situation model, no internal simulation occurs; without simulation, purpose cannot form.


**Understanding** exists only when the mind can simulate a complete situation by answering who acts, what is done, how it happens, why it occurs, when it matters, and where it applies.


and even it simulates possible applications of the mental model.
